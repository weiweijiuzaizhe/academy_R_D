### [KDD 的social network mining workshops]
 The 8th SNA-KDD workshop is proposed as the eighth in a successful series of workshops on  social network mining and analysis co-held with KDD, soliciting experimental and theoretical work on social network mining and analysis in both online and offline social network systems. Based on the previous success, this year we propose a special theme of “Social Network Study for Business, Consumer and Social Insights”, which is perfectly aligned with the theme of the main KDD conference. 另外，[KDD2014]整体也值得关注
